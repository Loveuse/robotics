University project for the class of Robotics. 

The purpose of the project was to use the board Intel Galileo to be able to move a vehicle. A gesture controller was added in order to control the direction and speed of the vehicle, unfortunately we didn't have a wireless controller and a wired one was used (you can imagine how fun was running behind the vehicle ðŸ˜„). 

There are some video recordings of the vehicle in action under the zip file "project videos".

Also, the project presentation made through Reveal.js is available.
